# Publisher and Subscriber

This is the initial attempt to send and receive data which works partly.
The publisher part of code publishes the data as a node, and the subscriber portion could subscribe to the data.

How to publish data:

Change the example data method in the Publisher class so that it does what it should do (returning the appropriate data).

Parameters that could be adjusted:

Line 26: timer_period = 0.5

could change the interval to suit the purpose

How subscriber code works:

It automatically receives the data published by publisher part. Users could change the example_recieve_data (ignore this typo) method in the subscriber class to deal with the data in an appropriate way.
